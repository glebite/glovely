# first try soldering to Aluminum:  
- failed - cold solder joint.  Not great quality.  
- received one bit of advise to warm/heat underneath (might work but afraid of carbon scoring on back preventing form adhesion to the paper strip...  
- received an idea to do more of a rat's tail attachment - might work too.
