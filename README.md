# glovely
A presentation tool with a laser!

# Overview:
Essentially this is Yet Another Glove Build (YAGB) which will allow the user to point their index finger and it will shoot out a laser pointer.  Closing the hand will turn it all off.  Two buttons will be on the index finger: page forward, page back.  Giving a thumbs up will make a happy face on the glove/circuit enclosure.  Expecting to use flex sensors, an HID capable dev board that can handle the flex sensors and happy face output.  Bluetooth yeah.

# materials arriving
2 sheets of velostat!

# materials arrived!  
Yes!

# located wearable material

# built my first ever flex sensor with Gorilla tape, conductive thread, and velostat!

# index finger - 60 mm x 10 mm
# thumb - 70 mm x 10 mm

# 3D printed sensor mounts
Essentially I'm hoping to use snaps to connect the flex sensor to the glove
but the female connector (top) would be bumpy and warping the sensor.  I
designed and 3D printed parts to fit the female top snap.  The sensor can
then be glued to the top of the snaptops.

# button work
Hardware is starting to come together.
Ordered the dev board.
Started to assemble the button board.

# case and components added  
3d printed the case and the tolerances are too tight!!!  
again, I'm learning that I need to design my own parts and not trust ones that I find online

# dremel time tonight
  4.921 mm (width of battery)  
- 4.723 mm (width of case)  
----------  
  0.198 mm  

  2.299 mm (width of feather)
- 2.241 mm (width of case)
----------
  0.058 mm
  
I'll clamp the unit into my vise and be very very careful...  :)  
(also use safety goggles!)  

# Dremel work is coming along okay - CPU board fits (also soldered headers)
Yup - working thus far - need to do some more surgery.

# fitting fine
Ugly dremel hacks but the battery fits too now!

# now on glove
Yes!  Yes!  Awesomeness!!!  This works!

# power rail board soldered
Yup!  Getting closer!

# laser mounted to holder and on the glove
It is now on - fits well and points nicely

# new sensor design - tired.
I will have more progress tomorrow after I get a good day!

# using old sensor  
I got the old sensor working, wired, and tested.  Built a new sensor interface board - mounted sensor mounts on the glove.

# flex sensor and laser together - mostly working...
Yup - mostly working but coming along - now onto the buttons...

# performed presentation without glovely... :(
It is true - sad but true.  The presentation went well but could have been cooler with the glove.

# new button board
Yup - back at it - soldered new button board and tested continuity
