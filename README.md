# glovely
A presentation tool with a laser!

# Overview:
Essentially this is Yet Another Glove Build (YAGB) which will allow the user to point their index finger and it will shoot out a laser pointer.  Closing the hand will turn it all off.  Two buttons will be on the index finger: page forward, page back.  Giving a thumbs up will make a happy face on the glove/circuit enclosure.  Expecting to use flex sensors, an HID capable dev board that can handle the flex sensors and happy face output.  Bluetooth yeah.
